## Description
The US Geological Survey (USGS) seeks to create a visualization tool for their earthquake data. They collect vast amounts of global data daily but lack a meaningful display method. The project aims to develop a visualization solution to educate the public and government organizations about Earth's challenges, potentially increasing funding support. <br><br><br>
